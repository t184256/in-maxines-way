Aneela's honeymoon with New Amsterdam waned at the same rate as her savings did.
But the falling out was well past the point of no return.
Now not just hopping back to Gerlinde,
flying back frozen was too rich for her wallet.
She just had to get her act together and sort it out.
Starting with the rent-- no, first she--

"Would you mind?"
A girl clad in a comically large shawl,
donning an obnoxious Chic-choc-berry-branded shopping bag,
was done wandering around
and set to occupy the same bench Aneela took.
As if it was the only bench in town.
"As a matter of fact, I'd rather have this bench to myself."
"Oh, OK then," she got up hurriedly, taken aback.
 "Sorry, I totally get that. I mean--
  Some of the best days of my life were the ones
  I had an entire planet to myself.
  Take care!"
She started waddling away.
"An entire planet?" Aneela repeated absentmindedly.
"All to myself. See you!"
"No, wait. You gotta be kidding me."
The girl stopped and adjusted her shawl.
"Which one-- What were you doing there?"
"I... used to pilot spiders."
"Spiders? Like, on a planet so dangerous, you were the only--"
"No, it was a very nice one, actually.
 And all I did was honing my gait, so that they could study it.
 Not the one you just did, my spider gait."
"Uh, OK," Aneela lost all interest in the implausible story long ago.

The girl took a few indecisive steps towards the bench:
"So, what fuels your sorrows, bird?"
"'Bird'?" Aneela frowned. "Who calls people 'birds' these days?"
"I don't know, my grandma did..." she lowered her eyes, reflecting.
"Sorrows... Same old. Money. Always the problem and the solution."
"I'm not sure about that," looks like the girl was up to a debate.
"It is. What else is out there?"
"I don't know. Now, when I've mentioned it, I do miss that job,"
 the girl sighed, lowering herself onto the bench.
"Go find another one."
"Not many jobs come with a planet these days.
 Would money buy me a planet?"
"You don't have to buy a planet," Aneela remarked, irritated.
 "Just the company that fired you."
The girl zoned out, contemplating that simple idea:
"How would I ever earn that kind..."

"Ahem? Anything I can help you with?"
That jolted her back to reality:
"Look, I don't have the money to help you,
 and certainly not enough for a planet... or a company.
 But maybe you'd like a Chic-choc-berry? Drown your sorrows in added sugar--"
"Wait, are you a promoter?" Aneela jumped onto her feet in disgust.
 "You're supposed to just smile and hand them out--
  not make up sob stories!"
She stormed off, leaving the entire bench to the shawl girl
hugging her bag and mumbling under her breath:
"You're supposed to just smile and hand them out... Uh-huh..."
