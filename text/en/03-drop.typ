"What's the point of it? You have the video,
 I saw them arrest her-- she's somewhere here as well, is she?"
"Look, the best I can do is to make it quick,"
 Investigative Assistant Mike Kempt nodded with compassion.
 "Let's just get this over with, OK?
 How did you end up on that other cable car?"
"Hoo, starting from when exactly?
 I had to jump over drunk Chris lying across the stairs, but the rest of my--"
"Actually, if you could start a little earlier--"
"Immigration? Childhood?"
Mike frowned at her. She was the one holding them up.
"--like, what brought you to Nordview; when did you decide to visit it and why?"
"Ah, this morning--"
"--perfect--" he gestured, inviting her to elaborate from here.
"--Derek texted me-- last night, actually. Invited me for a drink at the top,
 there's this bar, whatsthename, the Nordview Bayview or something,
 it's a bit of our usual place for..."
"Go ahead."
"You know, Derek's always up to things,"
 she answered elusively.
 "And when he invites me,
  I just can't pass up on mocking him for all his previous get-rich-quicks.
  For an accountant,
  he's amassed quite a track record of being a total dumbass with his money,"
  she paused for a patronizing smile.
  "Nordview means he thinks he's gonna make a killing. Again."

"Do you know any details?"
"No, we didn't get to, actually, meet,"
 she stared Mike down as if he said something stupid.
 "But I'm sure it was yet another patently stupid invest-idea
  that I'd mock him about the next time to no--
  Wait," her eyes lit up. "He doesn't remember, now he's reverted--
  how many years, three, four? Boy, I'm gonna tell him all of it at once,
  I have to be the first one to retell it back, starting with that bee scam..."
"There are no bees in--"
"See!"
She pulled out her phone already.
"I'm sorry, I can't make it quick if you keep--"
"Right," she reluctantly put the phone down,
 the smile of anticipation still haunting her face.
"And your relationship with Derek--"
"We used to work at Barney's, branch accountants, me and him.
 But he's freelancing now. Better ask him--"
"If it was less than four years ago, you--" Mike shrugged.
"Oh, right."
She processed that for a few seconds.

"So, this morning."
"Yeah, I don't know what you want to hear, sorry.
 I drove there, on time, he was, like, twenty minutes late,
 but, when he called me, it was somehow my fault that for making him wait.
 That's Derek for you.
 And then, when he saw me,
 he went to board the next car and I didn't make it,
 so I had to take the next one."
"Do you find that suspicious?"
"Uh, no? He's just... being himself."
She wanted to say something else, but changed her mind.

"OK, so, halfway up, a thirdway up, perhaps, this girl zips down the cable,
 from his car to mine. She's the killer, isn't she?"
Mike ignored the question:
"Could you, please describe her?"
"Come on, how many more stewards with giant hooks and all that gear
 have you arrested today?"
 she sneered.
 "So, I'm like: 'wow, a steward, that's new', and she's like:
  'yeah, yeah, would you like a drink? here's the button if you need me'.
  Waited for a bit more and left for the next one."
"Have you noticed anything unusual about her?"
"Come on, the whole zipping around part? No? OK, then, nothing."

"And then?.."
"OK, and, a minute later, she returns and somehow goes, like, around my car?
 Without entering..."
 she gesticulated.
"Are you sure it was her?"
"Absolutely. She was much slower going upwards,
 so I had plenty of time to watch.
 Y'know, there ain't much stuff to look at."
"The Bay?" Mike suggested.
"Yeah, for your first time, maybe? The view's the best at the top anyway.
 So, she rolled back-- up --all the way to Derek's car,
 and then, a minute or two later, the door opens again,
 and he-- someone plummets to his death," she grimaced.
 "I didn't get a good look, for the better, I guess...
  He was right below me--
  yeah, and the ropeway stopped shortly after,
  just to restart almost right away...
  And I saw her getting arrested at the top as I was disembarking.
  She-- I think she said he groped her, and she was so eerily calm about it...
  They confiscated that hook of hers and boarded a car down,
  and Derek wasn't there, so I kinda just stood there, confused.
  Then an officer asked me if I saw anything and brought me here."
"Have you talked to her? Has she addressed you, maybe?"
"No, no..."
"Back on the ropeway, did you see them fight or interact in any other manner?"
"I only saw him fall-- already falling. No, I only saw her at the top."
"Anything else?"
"... Not really, no? It was all rather-- underwhelming at the top?
 I felt like I was the only one stressing out.
 I doubt many visitors noticed anything-- anything but the stop, I mean,
 and the arrest, I guess--
 Yeah. That's it."
"See?" Mike attempted a reassuring smile. "It didn't take that long.
 I don't think we'll require more details, but, in case we do,
 we'll reach out to you. Thank you--"
"What's next for her, a trial?" she asked on her way out.
"Why, yes, she killed a man," Mike blinked in surprise.
 "Someone's gonna foot the bill-- not to mention it's murder.
  What if he had no scan?"
"Yeah, that was a silly thing to ask," she nodded. "Goodbye?"
"Have a pleasant rest of the day."

Mulling over the best catchphrase for such occasions,
Mike got intercepted by Ahmed.
"At last. We're leaving, now," the Detective handed him a coat.
"Huh?"
"I need a chat with this Derek guy.
 The respawn flagged him. Have you found anything?"
"Uh, no? You?" Mike replied, short of breath from running downstairs.
"The oddest thing being?"
"The missing footage? How everyone seems to worry about the killer?
 Yet nobody believes her?"
"Hm. You're gonna like this one then," Ahmed sent Mike a video.
"Where are we heading, where is he?"
"Respawn, 'The New Dawn'."
Once in the car, Mike delved into the recording.
An unassuming bearded man with a silly haircut sitting on a bed,
not feeling at home in this soulless single-use hospital gown.
Derek.

"Mister Derek Hayward,"
 blasted the soothing voice of a nurse used to doing this all day long.
Mike frantically dialled the volume down.
"That'd be me, sir. Have I died?"
"I'm afraid so, yes. Don't worry, you're safe here.
 You didn't specify any friends or family we could notify, so,
 whom would you like us to call?"
"No-no, thank you, I'll manage," Derek got worried, his eyes started wandering.
"... Are you sure?" the nurse asked softly.
"How long--" Derek ignored the question.
"Four years and twelve days."
"OK," Derek massaged his forehead for a few seconds. "Am I free to go?"
Mike arched his eyebrow.
"Don't you wanna know what happened?" the nurse went off-script, off-beat.
"Oh. Yeah, sure."
"It says you... got into an altercation with a waitress while on a ropeway."
"Do ropeways of the future have waitresses?"
 Derek wondered absentmindedly.
"That's news to me as well," the nurse chuckled.
 "But sounds like they do, and this one allegedly threw you overboard..."
"Okay..."
"... after you, allegedly, sexually assaulted her."
"Me what?"
Derek's eyes darted towards the camera in disbelief, he took a long blink.
The nurse sustained the pause before proceeding:
"I'm sorry, you didn't look nearly as surprised when I men--"

"Shit!" Ahmed slammed his phone down and winced.
"What happened?"
"They lost him!
 They say he wandered off without his phone, and now they can't find him."
"'Wandered off?!'" Mike exclaimed, rubbing his nose and rewinding the video:

"... I'm sorry, you didn't look nearly as surprised
 when I mentioned you got thrown outta a cable car by a waitress."
"Well, yes, sir," Derek regained his composure,
 "that does sound like me. Can I have a word with her?"
