= The tumble
// ltex: language=en-GB

Peter didn't notice Elizabeth approaching; but the pilot did.
She sat barely interested, her pale unimpressed face
posing a stark contrast to Peter's restless hands:
"... her swarm, as she doesn't even deploy one, a swarm, I mean!
 Just one lookahead scout, and that's it."

Peter finally followed the pilot's gaze towards Elizabeth,
leaving an opening for the girl's remark, blunt and heartless:
"And?"
Peter froze for a second, blinked several times
as he unwound his musings back to whatever was the starting point:
"Yeah, and the spider to finish first wins the race, so to speak."
"Sounds simple... old-school even."
"Simple?" Peter had a little outburst.
 "It's not, couldn't be further from 'simple'--"
 Peter stumbled, his gesturing continued well past his words.
"Like, you can't put a Maxine into each and every spider?"
Elizabeth stole the reins:
"Why, we can send humans everywhere. That's what we do, actually.
 It's not a 'who' wins question, it's a 'when' question.
 So far, Maxine always wins. Still, one day,
 Pete's autopilots will become not just cheaper, but also better.
 Elizabeth."
"Elektra. So, you're the loser's boss?"
That made Peter flinch and wander off into the woods.
"No, I'm..."
"The judge?"
"I was told there'll be nothing to judge," Elizabeth scoffed.

They waited patiently, as the spider's "egg" unfurled.
Graced with a constitution of a ballerina,
Maxine stumbled towards them like a sailor washed ashore.

"Where were you?" Elizabeth roared.
"You want me ready or still warming up?" Maxine barked back.
"Why dismantle then?"
"My back! It--"
"Whoa, calm down, you two," Peter interjected. "You're on time."
Maxine stared at Elizabeth defiantly, her chin tilted upwards.
Though that could be just the height difference.
"Elektra," the pilot has introduced herself.
 "Sorry, uh, where were you coming from? I mean, it has to be close if you--"
"A very nice valley over there," Maxine gestured over the crest.
"Oh, that one. And you just--"
"Live there alone, yes. It's not as bad as it sounds. Pete!"
"What now?"
"How about no drills? I know you can't drill for the--"
"I don't need your--"
"So, you didn't plan to," Maxine smiled, pleased of herself.
"You--" Pete caught Elizabeth's stare,
 "--the most gracious rider of them all, the gait of the galaxy,
    the gift to all of us that just keeps on giving,
    please kindly spare us your gestures of... kindness.
    Just lead the race with that unique grace of yours
    we all struggle to imitate.
    No need to stoop to my level, drills or no drills."
"Don't forget to close your mouth while I do, lest your venom might dry up,"
 Maxine chose to ignore Elizabeth's stares.
"Do you two always--" Elektra began.
"Yes."
"No," they replied in sync.
"Jokes aside, Peter's doing what he can. Ain't his fault I'm this good,"
 Maxine added.
"And that condition of hers just keeps progressing," Peter nodded.
"Speaking of which," Maxine squinted.
 "You guys, still bent on speed alone to rule it all?"
Pete shrugged back absentmindedly.
"Boy, I can't wait to show you one thing."
"You're not the only one with new tricks up your sleeve, y'know."
"Should I stay behind to check them out or what?"

"So, she's got... this..." Elizabeth bit her tongue, unsure how to put it.
"The bulkiest socket under the stars?"
 Pete tapped his neck.
 "Gotta keep that datajack plugged in, somehow."
"Yes. Won't she, y'know, die if she, say, slips in the shower?"
Pete raised his eyes from the screen:
"Wouldn't you?"
"I mean-- heh."
"If she's ever gonna slip and die, I bet that'd be no shower."
"... OK, what does she think she's doing now?"
"It's Maxine, she alwa--" Pete replied without looking.
"No, Elektra."
"Huh," Pete turned his head.
The girls laughed and bumped their bracelets.
Maxine turned away to wipe her hands with a towel,
as Elektra hurried back towards them.
"I've got the soundtrack!" she proclaimed, raising her bracelet triumphantly.
Pete shook his head, preempting the unasked question.

They hovered above the start.

Pete's spider stood still, ready to lurch forward,
drones slowly circling it.
Maxine's bounced restlessly, her drone hovering still.

"Three, two, one, go?" Elektra smiled from her trance.
"No, that's on Maxine," Pete dismissed that nervously.
A sudden guitar riff made them shiver, then yielded to drums.
Pete's spider has already stormed off towards the cliff's base;
Maxine just shifted the weight to the left.
"What a show-off," Pete spat out.
"Whom do I--" shouted Elektra over the new wave of guitars.
"Maxine!" Pete shouted back.

Drums came and go, Maxine bounced to the right.
At the onset of growling, she lurched forward,
and so did the hover, pressing Pete and Elizabeth into their seats.
The rhythm guitar joined at 160 BPM,
half-tempo of her signature 5â…“ Hz chatter Pete spent so many hours analysing,
yet never mapped to any music before.
Maxine switched from 6-canter to 8-gallop, as the hover jolted to keep up.

Pete's spider reached the cliff first, and switched to rotoclimbing.
Maxine, a staunch non-believer in the Laskaris theorem,
just accelerated upwards off everything grabbable in sight,
even if it occasionally tore off and fell down.
Pete found himself frowning at the chorus,
as it was just too calm for the nerve-wrecking chaos unfolding in front of him.

She took the lead, but that didn't last for long.
A good half a cliff later, she got particularly unlucky,
tore off two pieces at once, losing and never regaining her breakneck pace.
Pete's spider rotated for the last time and ran for the woods.
Seconds later, Maxine's drone soared up sky-high for a wider overview.
Maxine, as she reached the top,
spent the remnants of her leftover speed on a... handstand.

"What the--?" Elektra slipped through her trance.
"Only a single drone, remem--?" Pete replied.
Maxine toppled forward and started tumbling down off course.
Straight downhill,
good twenty degrees and growing to the right of the destination.
"Oh dear," Peter froze in disbelief, unwilling to believe his intuition,
 sustained another jolt and switched to swearing.
Elizabeth's palm got pressed into her lips.
The jolt didn't stop as they plummeted downhill;
Maxine showed no signs of slowing down.

"How does she roll?" Elizabeth muttered, too quiet to be noticed.
"The river," Peter thought.
 "She's not racing to the finish, she's just rolling downhill.
  She's gonna hit the river."
His mouth, instead, uttered:
"The river! She just rolls down-- the river!"
"What is she doing?!" Elizabeth shouted. "She's gonna wreck it!"
"Trust me, she already has!"

Maxine did steer to keep her course along the river,
yet the river led further to the right.
Sooner or later, she will have to turn--
and that was when the first leg tore off and bounced off a tree.
A second one followed soon,
except this one didn't fly off nearly as picturesque.
"She--"
Elizabeth cut herself short, as Maxine turned further to the right,
to jump over the river from a cliff, losing next to no speed on the landing.
She immediately started curving left off the natural landscape,
and the hover could not keep up with that turn.
"Turn back and follow her!" Pete cried.
"Up! Don't lose her!" Elizabeth shouted.
"Shut up you both, I never lost her!" Elektra snapped back at them.
 "A-- Oh no!"
"What--"
They dove steeply into the green nowhere on the left bank,
with no movement in sight, no nothing, just trees.
Peter had to guess from their own descent where she lay under the tree crowns,
a titanium ball of flesh.
The music hammered on, as if she was still running.

"In light of this new evidence, I have to ask you once again.
 Elizabeth Ford,
 have you altered any of the reports pertaining to the incident
 resulting in wrongful termination of my client?"

Elizabeth lost her last ounce of composure and screamed back, trembling:
"I forged that report! Happy?! With these very hands.
 It was a draw, and yes, the damage wasn't that bad...
 But you don't get it-- I was right there!
 If only you showed us cut her out, you'd see, everybody would--"
She reached for her throat, as if reflux caught her mid-sentence,
and finished after a pause, with a low ringing to her voice:
"If only you saw her shake. If only you saw her shake."
