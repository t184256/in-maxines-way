= The glide
// ltex: language=en-GB

The dusk yielded to the night, yet the rain poured on, unabashed.
I should've left long ago... that ship has sailed now.
After all, why not stay the night?
The cold bed at home is no better lure than the couch in the backroom.

With the last concern for today settled,
I arranged a date with a bottle of gin on the windowsill
and dimmed the ceiling to marvel at the wavering lights of the city. My city.
In fact, let's turn it off entirely.
Another lightning parted the sky,
offering me a glimpse into the darkest corners, even if for a brief moment.
A still of clarity, a peek under the veil of ignorance ---
not mine, of course. I know what makes this city tick.
It's built on grit and suffering--

Steps. Looming. Energetic.
And, with a turn of a doorknob, another person invades my cosy world.
Not before the light bouncing off my shiny "Private Investigator" plaque
momentarily blinds me. I should do something about it one day.

As a girl barges in, visibly distressed,
the automation blasts the lights on subserviently.
Squinting, her eyes rummage through the office before
she finds the one to share her sorrows with.
We finally lock eyes.
"Your plan is dogshit!"

. . . // 2

I sprinted to the office,
begging Feather to wait for me under my panting breath.
Too late.
"--and shove it up your ass!"
The boss's sonorous laughter filled the hallway.
I finally stumbled into the room and into Feather,
eliciting a smaller fit of laughter.
"Oh, hi, Derek."
Pleased to see a familiar face, the boss raised his hand in a halting gesture,
struggling to find a place for a bottle in his other hand
before settling for the table.
"I'm sorry, sir."
"Who is her?"
"That'd be Feather, sir."
"Oh, right! Glad to finally meet you, Featherfinger."
He shook hands with Feather
rapidly reddening way past her usual pale.
"I've heard about your... unique ways of persuasion--
 Tell me, Miss Featherfinger, have you ever considered introducing yourself?
 That-- Usually goes
 before you propose shoving construction cranes up people's asses? I'm--"
"I know who you are,"
 Feather was clearly having second thoughts about this escapade of hers.
"How do you guys put it," he addressed me.
 "If Feather tells you to get in, you fucking get in?"
"More or less so, sir."
"Good, good. Now, what brings you two here this marvellous night?"
She grabbed the bottle and took a few gulps.
"What else am I supposed to do, die on that stupid crane of yours?"
 she slammed it down and grabbed onto the table with both hands.
You just can't stop being abrasive, can you?
Another round of laughter.
"Oh dear... your pitching needs work, but you've got my attention... so...
 go ahead?
 Got feedback for something? A better plan, I presume?
 Should I let you run the thing?"
"That'd be the best," she persisted, shaking from the adrenaline.
 "I would run it infinitely better. Like a real heist, not a suicide mission.
  I can bring all the team I need, I just--"
"Look, I love the sound of that. Extremely intriguing, if you ask me,"
 he plopped into his chair.
 "Now, if only you'd also be so kind as to remind an old fool:
  what in the world are you talking about? Cranes?"
She stared at me.
"I'm afraid that would be my idea, sir,"
 I wiped the sweat off my forehead
 and stepped to the side to close the door at last.

Impact!
The alarm is blaring already, the window on the 80th floor gets blasted in.
They fall inside, onto its sharp remains.
This time there's a researcher in the room, who screams and runs away,
while they're getting up, groaning.
He stops screaming and locks the door from the outside.
"The first door is on May."
Feather set up the wiper, May is already done with the charge two.
Once she blasts the lock off the flimsy door
Feather closes her eyes, adjusting to her sensor swarm permeating the floor.
"Why not just hack their system?"
"I can't afford to get misled."
They retreat to the window to unfold and fold the glider back,
taking their sweet time to carefully inspect it.
Looks too intact to be true again. That warrants another check later.

"What are you waiting for?"
"Staff to leave the airgapped room."
She tapped on the long-ass room taking half the floor,
with two strips of smaller, windowed rooms to the both sides of it.
"You're wasting time."
"Yes, we are."
"Wait, where's the door to the other side?"
"There is none, the bay side is a low security zone."
She pointed at the second set of stairs.
"Kaboom?" the boss clarified.
"Kaboom."

Finally, the last two people run past them to the exit.
Feather rushes to the massive door, May stays behind to set up traps.
A much louder explosion later she drops that to catch up.
Feather leads her to the corner with the safe,
sets up another wiper,
then returns to the entrance to set up the fourth charge
as far away as possible.
"So, your plan is to slice right through."
"Yup. The simpler, the better, innit?"
"Yeah, maybe..." doubt lingered in his voice.
May extracts a large brick from the safe,
grabs the closest screen and ducks behind the table.
The fourth explosion.
"Where are all the guards?"
"Running upstairs. They can't use the lifts during the alarm."
"You gotta be kidding me."
Feather runs through the hole in the wall,
May tucks the screen behind some drawer, grabs the brick and follows her
onto a balcony at the end of the hallway.
"Since you bring all--
 I know a guy who knows a guy who'd black out the entire block for a tenner.
 Just to be sure."
"I'm interested."
Feather unfolds the glider, May attaches the harnesses.
They climb the guardrail and take a dive,
following the brachistochrone into the bay at breakneck speed.
"OK, I got the idea."
"Good. May, I'm jacking out. Practice your seeding and the solo drop."
Feather unstrapped the harness and plummeted towards the ground,
leaving May to struggle frantically with the glider.

"And this is better... how exactly?"
Feather raised her head from the notes:
"Much fewer loose ends? Takes just two? Reliable handover? No stupid cranes?"
"I see. Just the two of you..."
Done weighing the risks, he rattled his fingers, weighing the stakes.
And the stakes were acceptable. A lucrative order. And a mademoiselle dérangé.
"OK, why not? Looks all kinds of iffy, if you ask me, but what do I know?..
 Tell Derek you run the show now."
He stood up to shake her hand.
Feather's lips formed a manic grin.
"Thank you. I won't let you down."
"See? This is how you pitch ideas, Miss Featherfinger!
 Cranes this, cranes that..."

She attached her glider to the cable car,
stepped in and took a seat next to her accomplice:
"Hi, May. You're even younger than you pretend to be, aren't you?"
The teen nodded towards the nearest security camera.
"Oh, worry not, I know my way around these."
"Hi, Max," she answered, cautiously. "Or should I call you Feather?"
"Please don't," Maxine sighed. "I hate it."
"It's your gang name, innit?.."
 the name instantly became her prime interest.
 "How did you earn it? Lemme guess, that scarf of yours?"
"It's not," Maxine pursed her lips.
"Huh. Your weight?" she frowned. "Your clumsiness?"
"It's short for Featherfinger."
"Your last name? I thought--"
"My trigger discipline."

They sat in silence for a long while.
Maxine stood up to have a look at the bay and the tower they're breaking in.
A view she had seen a thousand times before.

"How are you gonna spend your share?" Maxine attempted to break the ice again.
"Isn't it bad luck to discuss it before--"
"Pfft. Sure.
 And God is real, we just strayed too far into space, and he lost us."
May hesitated:
"And you?"
"I could really use a second life," Maxine shrugged.
 "Somewhere far away. Maybe even Federation. My debt could wait."
May stared at her:
"Makes... sense," she blinked, befuddled.
 "I have one, otherwise-- yeah, I'm gonna travel."
"Nice! I heard you can now change into a boy for just a little extra.
 You could try that, see if it fits you.
 A short trip back and forth sounds like a good way to get the hang of it..."
May didn't answer for a while, and Maxine turned back to her, starting to worry.
Wasn't really the best moment to upset her.
But May wasn't mad, just staring at her silently.
"Everything alright?"
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you're mocking me.
 I was a boy for twelve years, Max. Before my hop."
"Okay," Maxine paused to think. "Do you like it better that way?"
"No."
"... why change then?"
"Women earn more on Amster, no matter-- You didn't know that?
 Are we even from the same galaxy?"
Maxine decided against striking up any more conversations.

"Is it time?"
"No. Higher. Plug your ears in the meantime."
"So that's why you didn't share the starting point.
 There's no point. You just wing it."
"There's no point."
"There's no point. Tee-hee. Wing it."

Impact!
The real alarm only rang once they already hit the floor.
Nobody in the room.
May crawled off the glass, stood up and pulled the door open right away.
It wasn't even locked!
Maxine stood behind the door, her eyes closed, her swarm spreading out
across the almost desolate floor.
May hid in the back of the room to inspect the glider.
Everything's in order. Unbelievable. Just like the simulations.
Maxine set up the wiper. So far, so good.

Not a soul between them and the airgapped room.
May struggled with the traps, her hands shaking.
Maxine ran off to deal with the door.

An explosion shook the building.
The walls were still humming, when a second, smaller shock followed.
May dropped everything and rushed in, passing Max on the way.
She stood behind the first corner, eyes closed, shaking her head.
Weird. Not the end of the world though. Unless she failed with the door?

No. The door lay on the floor alright.
What stretched behind a short hallway in front of her
was more of a shooting range, rather than the generic labs they've simulated.
Independent illumination. Nobody in the entire airgapped room.
At least there was no doubt as to what she needs to crack open:
a run-off-the-mill gun safe to the left of the entrance.
A cheaper one of the half-decent bio-buzzword midrange Staingees.
Not their utter crap budget garbage, but she'll manage.

Maxine ran in as well, paused to scan the shooting range.
She then fiddled with the second wiper,
and slowly walked along the bayside wall, examining it intently and frowning.
For some reason she picked neither the corner closer to the balcony,
nor the one furthest from May, but the centre of it.
Maxine stopped to whip out some gadget and pressed it against the wall;
let out a deep sigh and reached for the largest charge.

Not like May cared much, for she was on the roll.
Not even a minute later she smiled, shining like diamond.
Another twenty seconds, and here she is, opening the door for Max to reach in.
To no one's surprise, the prototype they were hired to steal was a gun.
An unwieldy pistol with a literal rainbow of wires
sticking out of a socket on its side.
All that was missing was a 'PROTOTYPE' engraving.

Maxine weighted it in her hand, grabbed May by the wrist to drag her out.
Right, the last detonation.
Real life explosions felt nothing like the simulations.
Nauseous, May suddenly felt grateful to Max
for insisting they always drilled the heist in silence.
A rule she broke the very next second:
"Jack shit".
May searched for her own comms button, but didn't press it in the end,
as it became fairly obvious what exactly went wrong. The wall stood strong.
Max stared at it, fuming, fists clenched, looking like she's gonna lose it.
Instead, she lowered her arms and calmly radio'd:
"May, bug them. I'll come up with something."
As if there was somebody else for her to address.

The accomplice rummaged through the room, looking for a screen, not finding any.
Couldn't be the case.
There's simply no way somebody would build a big-ass airgapped room
without putting a single computer inside.
Or make all their research notes on a phone
that leaves the room for the lunch break.
Maxine inspected what was meant to become their way out.

May finally found not one, but two screens,
inside a drawer choke full of candy wrappers.
She turned to Max triumphantly...
to find her nearby, aiming at the wall with the prototype gun.
May broke her silence as well:
"Hello! What would a ray gun--"
"I wanna try anyway."
"You moron-- don't you see, it's built to shoot in here!
 What are you hoping--"
She stopped herself short to not undermine her own hopes of getting out.

Maxine hearkened to the voice of reason,
tilted her head and lowered the gun slightly.
Just to smile at her next idea:
"Not if I place a charge there!"
She rushed towards the wall, and--
Gunshot! Panicked, she turned to the right and
instantly fired the prototype ray gun back,
freezing still at the centre of the room.
A brightly lit human practice target smack in the middle of the shooting range.
"F-f-feather!"
There was no more shooting back at them.
"The fuck was that?!"
"A guard," Maxine replied, still aiming outside.
"How many--"
"I didn't see that one either!" she barked, irritated instead of her usual calm.
Maxine stepped away, breaking the line of sight,
examining the gun in her hand.
"What are we gonna do now?"
"May, bleed them dry."
"On it," May grabbed the screens and ran to hide behind the safe.
Max peeked outside, ran to place another charge at the wall
and back to the entrance,
then closed her eyes, reaching out to the sensors she no longer trusted.
Before transfixing at the gun again.

This part was much easier than the safe.
May took a peek outside for herself and returned the screens to the drawer.
"Stop toying with the gun, Feather! Wrap it up and get us ou--"
"Shut up!" Maxine snapped out of it, angry at another mention of her gang name.
 "I didn't want to shoot him! Didn't even pull the trigger!"
"The fuck are you talking about?"
Instead of answering, Maxine turned towards the unrelenting wall
and slowly pulled the trigger... to absolutely no effect.
She then lifted the finger off the trigger, only to quickly return it.
Nothing whatsoever.
"See!" she threw up her hands merrily, as if it proved anything.
But since the first thing the ensuing shot did
was plunge the room into darkness,
that was the last thing May ever got to see inside this room.

"Get! me! outta! here! you! idiot!"
Maxine grabbed her wrist again to drag her out.
That gun must've had a quite some spread,
for the dimly lit guard's body looked
rather uniformly unfit for biometric authentication.
Minus one more way out, no matter how silly it was.
Maxine fell behind,
aimed into the darkness of the room and pulled the trigger. Nothing.
"Ah, whatever,"
 she mumbled, closed her eyes and put her finger on the trigger.
The third explosion rocked the place.

"May, fall back."
They dashed into the hallway, took a turn into the first room.
Max placed a chair next to the window opening,
May strapped herself to her harness.
It's a shame that it comes to this.
Max unfolded the glider outside, gave May a hand...
The moment of truth.
Max waited patiently for the wind to change and closed her eyes.
They dove, spiralling around the tower,
losing a good twenty stories to that manoeuvre.
As if they wanted a closer look at the police cordons in their honour.
They were supposed to coasting away above the city, not fly in it!
Once they finally set course for the bay,
May burst into tears, laughing.
Maxine was too busy setting off the wipers,
packing the stolen prototype and catching air currents.
Forget the nice brachistochrone, forget the wide seeding,
all she wanted now was to reach the bay and drop off the prototype.

And boy, she made it.
Yes, corners were cut.
Instead of the much-touted wide seeding,
she dumped the real container together with the fakes,
leaving them to scurry and hide on their own.
Ten minutes later, retrieving it would turn into their client's problem.
Her plan worked out after all. Mostly. Kind of.
The core part. She felt alive.
The chase has stalled behind.
Would be fun if this made the city shell out for a real coast guard.

Max tapped May's hand,
and together they folded the glider in-flight for the last time.
So much easier when you aim for the ocean instead of a window.
