Sometimes I contemplate taking her phone. For a quick peek.
Just to find out which year is it.
I'll never do it though. I don't have the guts to.

Of course, she pays me handsomely for this. The real me.
Somewhere out there, I'm probably swimming in money.
A kilo per day is a kilo, no matter how spread apart the days are.
I have no way of checking that she pays me, but I don't need one.
An extra kilo is peanuts compared to printing me every time.
I lost count how many times.
But, I mean, not paying me would be petty. And she's not.

She's a good mistress alright.
Avoids me, always leaves for a run when she prints me, yes,
but sometimes comes back when I'm still cleaning, and she's OK with it.
Sometimes ignores me, sometimes has small talk.
But she's always kind and calm with me nevertheless.
Nothing like the stuff I've heard about.

I once mustered enough courage to ask her a question:
"Am I doing a good job? Is everything OK?"
That caught her by surprise. She stopped to think of it, before replying just:
"Yes."
But it wasn't just an empty "yes". The kind of "yes" that means it.
And I'm pretty sure she then forgot where she was heading.

To think of it, that was many times ago.
She's probably not erasing me.
But there's no way of knowing without leaving some kind of marks.
And I don't want to leave any marks. I don't know why.

She isn't actually always alone here.
She had, like, twenty visits already?
Mostly that bearded fellow: handsome, reserved, equally courteous to both of us.
Kind.
I think he just tells her the news and leaves.
One day there was an old man. He tried to convince her of something.
I think they've compromised on it.
Twice it was a woman. Very tense. They didn't talk much.
When guests are coming, she always prints me first to meet them,
and then I clean up after a quick chat.

With two exceptions to date.

One time was when she printed Pete.
She really prepared for that one. First we stopped roaming the planet.
She built an actual shed, put up a second tent.
Poor guy didn't know what's going on. Maybe she abducted him? And copied?
But I think he called her by her real name.
So, might be a close friend of her.
Anyway, Pete stayed for eight days straight, and so did I.
That was weird.
I slept during the day in his tent while they built spider legs,
for her third spider.
In the evenings I helped Pete with surviving here.
Even figured it myself in the meantime.
Then I sat by the fire all nights, trying to understand
why she wants to live this way.
I almost did. But not quite.

And the second time was today.
The bearded fellow arrived first, and the angry woman came in second.
So, for the first time, there were four people at once.
They didn't talk much, just kind of sat there and stared at each other.
As if something bad happened and everyone blamed each other for it.
Then the miss told them to get into spiders.
They both started arguing, but she insisted.
Told them she's gonna pilot. Told them to get in. They left for the ridge.
I started cleaning.

And just a couple of hours later, they were back.
She and the guy. Just two spiders.
Nothing of the girl. The guy looked as if he came from the dead.
A pale shadow of his usual manners.
She went to cook without a care in the world,
and I helped him climb out of a spider.
He immediately stumbled to the fire to ask her:
"But what do I tell her back there?"
"Tell Deirdre you run the show now. And recruit more."
He swallowed and nodded:
"Yes, ma'am."
I put him into the teleport, and once he perishes, I will follow.

Someday I'll get into that box just to never be printed back.
Could be today, even. But I'm not complaining.
A job is a job, even if you are an illegal copy. And mine is fine.
