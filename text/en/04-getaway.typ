= The getaway
// ltex: language=en-GB

--how we lost Hog? That was one wild night in a circus...
So, we're in the boonies,
kidnapping the mayor's son, while the fat cat was out of town.
What was his... Gavin?.. The one that later got burned for organ farming. Right.
And of course Sunil had to trip the alarm.
Now we storm out to help, Hog and me, all decked out.
Yeah, and our getaway was a young girl,
her last time as a getaway, heh.
But I'm getting ahead of myself...
So, Sunil tripped the alarm and dashed upstairs for the kid,
but the kid took the pill first, so we turned--
yes, yes, the one with Feather shooting at him, so, have I told this one--
Fine, let me recall something else then... Gimme some time...

. . .

"Double-check that."
Hog rammed into the flimsy gates, busting them open.
The silence stretched out as we were closing in on the front door.
"Squad, fall back, the kid is dead. Sunil, you clean it up, I get you out."
Mission failed. Shit. Now all we--
"Turn back, you morons," she addressed us.
Right! I reached the porch anyway to push back off the stairs;
Hog went for semi-circling the lawn.
"Good, now get your ass moving... First wipe in three, two, one--"
The wiper went off in a distance, erasing traces of Sunil's presence
by mildly frying every exposed surface in that room.
I have to say, running away from the alarm and explosions
felt much more natural than running towards them.
Wait, the stairs.

"How about another one for the porch?" I radio'd her.
She was probably busy talking with Sunil, not replying till Hog reached the van.
And the dumbass stopped short of getting in to shout at her from the outside.
"Too late and useless," her terse reply filled my head.
"--??? ??? ??? lawn!" Hog barked at her meanwhile.
I zoomed past him, jumped straight in, and only stopped past the driver's lair.
"Get in,"
 She opened her eyes for a second
 to check on me from her ridiculous bathtub-like contraption.
  "Not you, Sunil. This one, we need it right above, alright..."

Hog stood outside like an idiot, screaming at the back of her head:
"We need to help him--"
"Hog, get in, right now," she reached for her stupid pistol.
 "Awesome, now head downstairs--"
"--him out and clean the--"
"Hog, what--" I tried to talk some sense into him as well.
"I said, get in," she repeated, this time supplementing her persuasiveness
 by sticking out her hand with the pistol, aiming back without looking.
"Max!" I lurched forward to stop her.
"--front, or they--"
She pulled the trigger --- the bullet ricocheting off the van's insides ---
a moment before I grabbed her wrist.
"Fuck!"
I crawled back with her pistol in hand and ducked behind the lair,
basically deaf,
expecting return fire for some reason, but Hog just... ran away, I guess,
as the van accelerated so sharply, I think I've displaced that bathtub.
"Hold onto something!"
"Are you nuts?!" I didn't recognize this voice. Quiet. Croaky. Mine.
"Hog, you're on your own. Sunil--"
She entered a turn that'd be outright impossible if not for the counterweight,
slamming one of the van back doors shut in the process.
"--through the kitchen and the backyard, yes, we're moving to pick you up.
 Last wipe in three, two--"
She sent the counterweight flying back for the next turn right.
I finally realized she's as deaf as I am and radio'd her instead:
"You left him behind! What the fuck?! You left Hog--"
She nodded at the distant blast and opened her eyes again to frown at me,
bewildered:
"He-- The fuck is wrong with him? I told him to get in!"
