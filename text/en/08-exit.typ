Detective Mike Kempt wasn't a fan of history in general.
Stuff happened. Move on.
Except there was one bit of trivia, a single weak spot of him.
A piece of history he witnessed with his own eyes on the New World square.

Ask pretty much anyone: "what did the protestors bring to storm the Senate?",
and, out of the plethora of actually meaningful weaponry out there,
people're gonna pick "orbital cannon". A funny bit of trivia.
Anyone with a modicum of common sense
would correctly infer it never fired a single shot.
Any space weaponry geek worth their salt would remark it was an old MODC-14.
It'd take a person who's been there to recall
that the riot police frantically scrapped it on the spot,
so that it wouldn't become a memorial.

Yet none of them would answer the very natural question of
how come an orbital cannon got to be towed around the streets of Amster.
At best, they'd mumble something about these days being hectic and all.
Those with level four security clearance could tell you that
an investigation conducted together with Strange Logistics
never found out who sent it.
An answer that wasn't enough for Detective Mike Kempt of yesterday,
and definitely not for the Lead Detective Mike Kempt.

It was a bit of a blur.
He just came home from the bar, the next moment he's already in an armchair,
opening one of the twenty related bookmarks on autopilot,
and he found himself staring at an icon he never expected to see there.

%"Shadow Queen" had "significant updates" icon next to it.
Over a career as long as Mike's, significant updates do happen.
Except "Shadow Queen" was never a link before,
there was no way Mike could read her file.
Yet "significant updates" implied he has.
And that she was a person. In fact, she was two.

Venturing further into this absurdity, plunging deeper into denial,
Mike discovered he had the honour
to be the last law enforcement agent to interrogate the second one,
the elusive Shadow Queen of New Amsterdam herself.
OK, fine, one of the last two, and it was mostly Ahmed, actually,
while Investigative Assistant Mike Kempt was there in the same room with them.
And Shadow Queen was a poor immigrant trembling after taking out a man,
none of them three realizing back then he was Derek fucking Stalwart himself.
A girl bailed with a large anonymous donation, a fact he vaguely remembered,
and later settling it out of court,
something he was pretty sure ain't legally possible.
It all sounded like a drunk dream, a hallucination of a tired mind.
Mike shook his head and went to bed.

But the next morning the files were still there, waiting for him to read them.
Beer by beer, the thrilling urban legends in his head
gave way to boring banalities.
Shadow Queen was not collective governance,
not a moniker for a dynamic conglomerate of allied gangs.
And neither she was the mythical Turkeys leader slain in the Baltimore clashes,
to get touted as a middle class hero later for no apparent reason.
She just appropriated the name.
Nor was she a good gangster, nothing like the real Shadow Queen.
What she actually was is a power broker,
defining New Amsterdam's shadow service market
without leaking a single fact about her for fourteen years straight.
To the point that wiretapping Stalwart's right hand, Deirdre Flanagan,
provided no evidence she existed, so Shadow Queen was declared a myth.
Until she quietly retired six years ago.

Two days after the Senate takeover,
among the full swing streets raging,
gangs a-clashing, empires crashing,
CEOs outta-windows-dashing,
she climbed out of a teleport,
and went to buy a house in Highborough with a nice discount.
Since then Shadow Queen drove the same streets he did,
in a white Largot he might've seen in traffic.
Shadow Queen had a daughter, a phone, a social security number,
and a health insurance with NAmCo.
And Shadow Queen, real name Maxine Delilah Strange,
owned and operated "Strange Logistics".
Were the cannon her parting symbolic gift to the streets,
it was as subtle as a shot in the head.
From an orbital cannon.

So Mike decided to just ask her.
And that's how he found himself standing in a hall of a posh ballet school.
A classroom door opened and girls in white dresses, first-graders, maybe,
fled it like a gas streaming out of a cracked vessel.
Struggling to tell them apart,
Mike turned to watch their cheering parents instead.
Likely some of them were help,
but most of them were rich brats with too much spare time on their hands.
And one of them also doubled as a crime lord holding answers to--
Bam? One of the girls bumped into him.
Running her merry way, head turned to the side,
she ran into his leg and scattered on it, flying away and onto her ass.
Mike made a hesitant step towards her,
the girl looked his way in expectant silence,
as if deciding whether to cry or not about it.

"Do you want to kidnap me?"

"Fee!"
A couple of seconds later a woman squeezed past Mike and to the girl,
put her on her legs and started inspecting her:
"Are you alright? Are you hurt?"
Her signature white shawl not standing out much when worn over a white coat.
In a different hood, she could pass for her grandma. Not in Highborough though.
The woman then straightened up, holding Fee's hand, and addressed Mike:
"You're getting overly insistent in your attempts to contact me."
"I didn't do anything, she just--"
"What do you want from me, Detective?"

"I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about the orbital cannon you--"
"A cannon, you say?" Maxine smirked.
 "In a world full of actual mysteries,
  you were tasked to track a cannon?"
"It's not an official investigation, at least not--"
Fee, already bored, attempted climbing up Maxine's arm like a monkey,
eliciting an unexpectedly stern reaction:
"Fiona, you're a big girl now. We don't do that any more. How do we do it now?"
Fee reluctantly stepped back and gave her a hand
for a guided jump onto Maxine's shoulder, more befitting to a ballerina.
"Excuse me--"
"Mummy, did he want to kidnap me?"
 Fee probably thought her whispering was quiet.
"No, I--"
"No, sweetie," Maxine found it funny.
 "Detective Kempt works for the police.
  If someone kidnaps you, he'll be the one catching them!"
"Hm," Fee let her hair loose in the meantime
 and started to chew on it to aid thinking,
 casting a glance full of doubt onto Mike.
"By the way, what do we do if someone wants to kidnap you?"
Fee immediately rolled up her eyes, lowered the jaw with her mouth open and--
"No! Don't--" Mike recoiled back in horror.
 "I'm not-- Yes. Good girl," he exhaled with relief
 as Fee rolled her eyes back to give him a victorious look
 and returned to chewing her hair.
"Good girl," Maxine echoed him. "So, why the interest in some old cannon?"

"I was there that day--"
"Oo, nice. Cause I was outta town. Shame."
"--and I always thought it'd-- if it was preserved, somehow,
 it'd be the best-- symbol of... what you did."
"Me?" Maxine was clearly proud of herself.
 "You must be confusing me with someone.
  As I said, I was out of town back then."
"Yes. I know.
 It just so happened that you,
 after decades of staying in power, decided to retire that very week.
 And it was 'Strange Logistics' who brought it--"
"Oh, here we go again.
 Yes, there is a logistics company with my last name--"
Sure, the one with registered firepower
exceeding what the Earth was allowed to keep.
"--I'm not even a majority shareholder, and I sure don't run it.
 I've got better things to do these days, right, Fiona?"

Fee had a different question on her mind:
"Mummy, why are you talking to him? He's a cop."
"Good question.
 As you can clearly hear from where you stand,
 some questions aren't exactly... polite.
 Speaking about retirement timing.
 Sometimes it's just tiring to get stuck with the same job for decades--
 I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, Lead Detective Mike Kempt
 --sometimes you just let go all of a sudden."
"Oh, cut the bluff," Mike didn't like thinly veiled threats.
 "You cannot fire me."
"Are you sure about it?" Maxine suppressed a smile.
"Who do you think you are? Make Yusuf call me and fire me."
Maxine closed her eyes for two long seconds,
only to burst into a fit of laughter.
Fiona didn't like that at all and carefully hopped down to the floor
to roam around the now-empty hallway.
"What's the matter?" Mike kept his calm. "Should I give you a minute?"
"OK, Mike, you win this one,"
 she wiped the tears off her eyes, grinning wide.
 "I can't do that."
"Now, about--" Mike resumed, uplifted.
"Doesn't mean I'm gonna talk to you though.
 Fee? Fee, let's go. Diego, we're coming in fifteen--"
"I--"
"Goodbye, Mister Kempt. Don't bother me or my daughter ever again."

Mike followed them to the door to watch them hop into a white Largot,
pulled out his phone to stop the recording, and couldn't.
The phone was toast.
