= The rise

"Of course not, Derek. That'd be preposterous, Derek."
We were at some hotel restaurant on Atlanta,
so, basically kids by the standards of the rich geezers swarming the place.
And I have to admit, we acted the part.
"It's much more nuanced than you try to present it."
Even Derek. The only worthy opponent here.
If I had ten loyal aides this good,
I'd sweep all these olds farts off the playing field and into irrelevance,
overnight. It's high time to stand aside and let a new generation run the Fist.

"Dude, you're not following,"
 Jake grabbed my wine glass, wielding two now.
 "Do we side with the Turkeys and against them?"
 He offered both to Derek.
 "It's a yes or no question. What do we do, which one is it?"
The more I try to see past Jake's act,
the more I get entrenched in the idea that he's just a dumbass,
through and thorough.
"What for?" the clumsy ditz across me inquired quietly,
none of us paying attention to her.
She should be grateful to a seat at the adults table in the first place.

Derek picked my glass, if only to return it to me.
"Now, if you prefer dining metaphors, how about this one?"
Derek placed a spoon at the centre of the table.
"The balance of Amster is both stable and fragile.
 Stable in that there will always be a shadow service market.
 Fragile in who runs what. That's always in flux."
He rocked the spoon side-to-side; demonstrated that it's not rocking up-to-down.
"This is, actually, stable equilibrium,"
 the white shawl hanger reared her head again.
This time Derek acknowledged her remark.
"Well, yes, it's stable until you rock the boat too hard,"
 he tipped the spoon over.

"Sorry, I lost track, is it stable or not?" Jake frowned.
"It's stable until one goes too far, and then it's over."
 Derek patiently offered a second demonstration.
Oh, come on.
"The Turkeys want to rock the boat."
 I explained to the gifted.
 "To upset the balance, And you want to help."
"Well, yeah?" Jake shrugged. "How about we do this?"
He hit the spoon at its tip, sending it flying towards the nearby pool.
While they were following its flight,
I quickly placed my spoon onto the now vacant place.

"Huh?" Jake marvelled at the replacement.
"Nicely put, Dee," Derek smirked and patted my shoulder.
"OK, think I get it now," Jake stretched out the words.

"Don't sprain his thinking muscle, and stop toying with spoons,"
 the angsty ballerina grabbed my spoon from the table,
 spilling her wine in the process, in between her and Jake and onto the floor.
Low gravity, even by New Amsterdam standards, was integral to Atlanta's charm.
In part, because it made so easy to spot those who don't belong.

"A-and I forgot what it was about anyway," Jake turned to watch her fume.
Jake is just an idiot. While she's a dangerous one.
But she's also easy to manipulate.
I should tap into her embarrassment. Turn her anger to my benefit.
"I can't stand you dolts," she suddenly erupted.
 "Now, when I know who's at the wheel-- how are we even afloat?
  You're too busy playing with spoons to actually run the thing,
  or you'd fuck it all up in no time."

"Looks like you beg to differ, Feather--" Derek nodded towards her.
Right. Feather.
"--what would you rather do with the Queen's offer?"
"What for?" the broken record in a white shawl repeated.
Nobody answered her for a second.
"See?" she grinned. "You can't even answer that. You--" she pointed at me,
"To maintain the balance," I interrupted her. "Queen mustn't get cocky."
"Then talk her out of it?" she lowered her voice.
 "Prevent the bloodbath, then eat us in peace as you planned. You--"
 she turned to Jake.
 "All you want is to raise chaos and bite a larger piece for yourself."
"Okay, so should I--"
"No! Stand aside and wipe whoever comes on top!"
"Hmm..."
"And what about me?" Derek inquired.
"And we all know Derek is only in it for the money," she finished.
"What course of action would that correspond--" Derek scratched his beard.
"I don't know, buy the senate? invest like a normal person?
 Where's the money these days, underground clinics? weapons? logistics?"
She straightened up, almost tipping her chair over.
"Where are we heading if you want balance, you want power and you want money?
 I'll tell you-- nowhere.
 You're just irrational thugs with no vision,
 you just do what makes you feel cool!
 I'm sick of you. If that's who have to work with, I quit!"

She stood up with such vigour, I had to save the table from tipping my way--
grinning wide as Feather slipped on her stupid shawl.
Seconds of delightful slow-motion later we had a garçon on his fours,
food from his tray flying all over the place
and an unlucky old man floundering in the pool.
"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"
 she addressed the garçon before closing her eyes for a few seconds.
 "It's OK, I bought the place!"
  she told Derek, who was about to stand up and help her.

"So what, bird?" the old chap in the pool proclaimed.
 "So that it's your problem now?"
 He sampled a berry floating past him.
 "I'd like to file a complaint then."

. . . // 3

About a week of rampant mockery later, after Baltimore, yeah,
right after we wiped the Turkeys,
Feather even cut and showed us a clip of
this old fart's derisive "so what, bird?".
Too late, 'bird', for we'll forever remember him saying "what for?" instead.
